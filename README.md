These are assignments, code snippets, and projects I worked on throughout my IST curriculum at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  

IST degree requirements found at: http://www4.uwm.edu/sois/programs/undergraduate/degreereq.cfm

By no means are they polished products but rather examples of me practicing web design fundamentals.
