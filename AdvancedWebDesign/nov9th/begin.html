<p>
In the winter time when the air is too cold for running John Smith likes to cross country ski.  Cross country sking is a great workout and is easier on the joints then running (assuming you don't fall).</p>

<p>1. Get Motivated "Make a date to meet someone for a run," says Jean M., a reader in Colorado. "There's no wimping out when someone is waiting."  </br> </br>
2. Arm Your Feet
To keep warmth in and slush out, run in shoes that have the least amount of mesh.
</br> </br>
3. Get Dressed
You want to be warm without sweating so much you get a chill. "The rule of thumb is to dress as if it is 20 degrees warmer," says Maine Track Club president Mark Grandonico. 
"You should be slightly cool when you start." Think layers of technical fabrics, to wick sweat, with zippers at the neck and underarm area to vent air as you heat up.
